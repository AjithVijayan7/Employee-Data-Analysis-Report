# Employee-Data-Analysis-Report

1. Heading and Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze employee data and gain insights into various aspects such as team distribution, position segmentation, age groups, and salary expenditure. Specifically, we aim to understand the organizational structure, identify patterns, and provide actionable recommendations.


2. Expected Outcome:
Our expected outcome is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the employee dataset and present findings in a clear and informative manner. Additionally, we will create visualizations to enhance the communication of insights.



3. Data Call:
We have obtained an employee dataset containing the following features:
Name: Employee names
Team: The team to which each employee belongs
Number: Employee identification number
Position: Employee position (e.g., PG, SF, SG, PF, C)
Age: Employee age
Height: Employee height
Weight: Employee weight
College: College attended by the employee
Salary: Employee salary


4. Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values:
Identify and address wrong values in the dataset.
To correct the data in the "height" column, random numbers between 150 and 180 were generated and replaced with the existing values to ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with the analysis.
Feature Scaling/Normalization:
Normalize or scale features to ensure consistent scales.



6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
Visualize data using plots (bar plots, pie plots, scatter plots).
Identify patterns, correlations, and relationships between variables.



8. Feature Engineering:
Create new features if they provide valuable information for modeling.
Transform existing features to enhance their suitability for modeling.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) if needed.


9. Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (80-20 split) for model evaluation.



11. Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on problem nature and data.
Consider factors such as interpretability, performance, and scalability.



13. Model Training:
Train selected models using the training dataset.
Optimize model hyperparameters (e.g., grid search, randomized search).



15. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Accuracy, F1-score).
Compare different models to select the best one.

16. Model Deployment:
Predict on the test dataset and save the trained model.



18. Documentation and Reporting:
Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing project findings, insights, and recommendations.
Communicate the results effectively to stakeholders, including non-technical audiences.
